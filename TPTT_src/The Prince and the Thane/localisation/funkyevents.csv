EVTDESC102005;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has come to me full of praise and flattery for my good judgement, requesting that I should revise the terms of my succession so that my land passes to my children, rather than risking it falling to some distant stranger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102006;I am my father's child as much as my elder sibling.  Why should I therefore be left with nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102007;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has come to me humbly, arguing that it is unjust that all my titles should pass to my eldest upon my death and leave [From.GetHerHim] with nothing.  [From.GetSheHeCap] suggests that it would be a mark of justice and of kindness both if I should declare the law of gavelkind instead, and ensure a brighter future for all my children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102008;My liege is an honorable and a likeable sort. Surely he would understand that a realm is better-run when it is an arrangement more of equals, when the right man is selected for the throne, rather than it simply falling to a firstborn child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102009;My vassal, [From.GetTitledFirstName], in the midst of one of our friendly discussions, has broached the subject of succession.  [From.GetSheHeCap] speaks abstractedly of feudal elections, which would allow the throne to pass to whichever candidate had [From.GetHerHis] approval, and that of the rest of my vassals.  It seems evident that [From.GetSheHe] is subtly suggesting I should enact such a change in my own realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102010;I am the eldest of my line, and the wisest.  Yet my liege would pass off the crown to some trifling child!  What am I to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102011;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has come before me strongly suggesting that I should declare my realm to follow inheritance by seniority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102012;My father has no legitimate sons to inherit the throne, and so if he should die, it may pass to god-knows-whom.  Why must he maintain this foolish law, when I could rule as well as any man?  What am I to do? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102013;My daughter, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has come before me almost tearful, speaking her concerns for the fate of my throne if I should pass without a male heir.  She points out with some reserve that in many lands a daughter is permitted to inherit when there is no rightful son, and says that she would be willing to take on this burden, if only to keep the crown from being taken by a stranger...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102014;My brother, the so-called 'rightful heir,' is a fool, and would see our realm in ruin!  It is an injustice even that he would inherit first, simply for the fact that I was born a woman, when I would be by far a better ruler.  What am I to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102015;My daughter, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has come to speak to me in private, delicately pointing out what I already know - that my son, my heir, is poorly-suited to the throne.  That she would be in many ways a better successor, when I should pass. She is my eldest, but she is a woman, and cannot precede my son for the inheritance...at least, not as the law now stands. But she is clearly suggesting a most shocking change, that sex be disregarded altogether for such matters, as though women were equal in every way to men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102016;I am fortunate that my liege runs his realm according to the law of feudal contract, permitting me a chance at the throne if he should unexpectedly pass...but there is a kind of insult to the fact that he allows women to cast themselves as contenders, as though they were as deserving of the crown as men.  What am I to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC102017;My vassal has come before me, quietly complaining of the insult that is accorded to men and woman both when the latter are permitted to run as contenders for the throne.  They may serve passably enough, he points out, in dynastic realms, when there are no suitable male heirs - but there is no need for such contrivance in our present status, where there are no end to the men qualified to rule. He would have me change the law, so that only men are permitted a chance at the crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEedicts.6;The Statute of Merton;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCedicts.6;The Statute of Merton or Provisions of Merton, sometimes also known as the Ancient Statute of Merton, is considered to be the first English statute, and is printed as the first statute in The Statutes of the Realm. Amongst its provisions, the statute allowed a Lord of the Manor to enclose common land (provided that sufficient pasture remained for his tenants), and set out when and how manorial lords could assert rights over waste land, woods, and pastures against their tenants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAedicts.6;It's for the greater good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEedicts.7;Quia Emptores;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCedicts.7;Quia Emptores was a statute that prevented tenants from alienating their lands to others by subinfeudation, instead requiring all tenants wishing to alienate their land to do so by substitution. Quia Emptores, along with its companion statute of Quo Warranto, was intended to remedy land ownership disputes and consequent financial difficulties that had resulted from the decline of the traditional feudal system during the High Middle Ages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEreligious.6;Jubilee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCreligious.6;The concept of the Jubilee is a special year of remission of sins and universal pardon. In the Biblical Book of Leviticus, a Jubilee year is mentioned to occur every fifty years, in which slaves and prisoners would be freed, debts would be forgiven and the mercies of God would be particularly manifest. In Christianity, the tradition dates to 1300, following which ordinary jubilees have generally been celebrated every 25 or 50 years. Christian Jubilees, particularly in the Catholic tradition, generally involve pilgrimage to a sacred site, normally the city of Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAscots.1;Yes let us be one with our serfs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCscots.2;Around our lands more people are using this Scots language and I find this is a perfect means for a Norman overlord to get his Saxon and Gaelic serfs to work properly.

EVTOPTAscots.2;We are indeed wise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCscots.3;Although every civilised man in Christendom knows that French is the true language of communication, this new Scots language does have a certain functionality. I have therefore prevailed upon a member of my court to adopt this for everyday administrative use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjob_flavour.0;Not unlike every other morning, a bunch of noble and peasant petitioners assembled in the great hall with various demands and requests.

EVTDESCjob_flavour.6;A foreign envoy from an infidel land just arrived at court with a score of queer companions, bringing along with him many gifts from his homeland.

Her blue eyes have something satanic about them, the leader of the mob says, and when he asked her what she was doing with all those herbs she picked up in the fields she wasn't able to give him an acceptable answer, he says, hence she must be a sorceress..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.11;Appalling rumors: My lord liege has been increasingly spotted coming in and out of one of the most luxurious brothels of the capital, and it is now murmured that he spends more time 'whoring' than caring about the realm, and I can't even begin to describe what his Holyness' reaction will be if he hears that I justify those sinful actions under my direct watch..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.12;Of that day and hour no-one knows: no, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, until the flood came and took them all away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.13;The realm's debt towards foreign banks and crowns is higher than ever, and the representatives of those who are owed money are suggesting that if we don't pay them back immediatly, they will raise the interest of another 10%, something we truly cannot afford right now in those times of financial duress..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.14;The latest economic policies I suggested and started to implement are turning out to be much less effective than I anticipated, and now the coffers of the realm are empty and my liege has only me to blame for it, as many and more are starting to claim..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.15;Those are hard times for the realm: The enemy is at our doorstep, and my liege is asking me to find more gold to finance the war. I thought I already did everything I could, but after a lot of calculations I realized there are still opportunities to find wealth out there for those who aren't afraid of getting their hands a little dirty in the process..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.16;Tiresome news: An increasing number of pious men, together with many peasants, are starting to complain about the presence of Jewish moneylanders in the realm, claiming that such practices are no less than the Devil's work and that I should make them stop at once, no matter what the repercussions might be..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.17;An envoy of foreign merchants just arrived at court, asking for a meeting with the treasurer straightaway. As I approached them, they showered me with gifts of gold, salt and some queerer spices and jewels, promising a much richer deal if we were to reach some kind of trade agreement with them..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.18;My liege's spending seems to be endless: there isn't a day where whole sacks of coins seem to simply disappear towards another crazy expense, making my job as a treasurer twice as hard and thrice as troubling. Something must be done about it, but what will it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.19;The troops clearly lack even the slightest concept of discipline: they march in queerly formed ranks and are hardly governable and poorly disciplined, not talking about the way they make camp, or the basic lack of everyday drills of swordsmanship and bowmanship, a practice that even the weakest of our enemies surely makes sure to have up and running in his armies. Something must be done about it, better sooner than later..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.20;As I approached our chief armorer, the situation already appeared more than dire: Even the newest swords and pikes are starting to rust, and the quality of their steel is questionable to say the least. He claims that this situation has been going on for longer than he can recall, blaming it on the lack of resources and skilled men to do the job right. Something must be done about it, and now is better than any other moment to act..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.21;Worrying news reached my ear this morning as I presented myself to the troops for a drill: A group of soldiers under my direct command have been accused of the drunken rape and murder of a teenage peasant girl. Having been recognized by the girl's relatives and a bunch of eye witnesses there wasn't much else I could do but imprison them on the spot, and now the peasants are calling for their heads, and their comrades are threatening to revolt if the same request is granted. I have to act before it's too late to avoid any further damage to our status and reputation on one hand, and the well being and morale of my troops on the other..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.22;A sergeant, one of the most skilled if not the best of our ranks, has been seen coming back to his tent with a young lad. While his fondness for women was always in doubt, some men are growing itchy of being under the command of someone they 'don't trust their arses with'..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.23;The most recent inspection of our stables reported an appalling situation: Most of the horses are either lame or too old to be decently ridden, and the ones that could be magnificent beasts are poorly nourished and scarcely ever cared for. The knights are complaining, claiming that they won't be able to face any real battle if they don't have reliable mounts below them..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.24;Treason! A small number of the newer recruits disappeared during the night, only to be caught by our scouts whoring and on their cups in a nearby village. Normally I would have their heads on a plate, but there have been so few recruits recently that we need any avaiable and willing man to our side..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.25;The guards inform me they just caught a foreign spy trying to overhear our last council session. Although they were about to kill him on the spot, I arrived just in time to stop them. I have different plans in mind about his fate, and this little incident could turn out to be more useful than those witless soldiers might think..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.26;My street informants have just reported me that there is a serious threat to the life of my liege going on: A few disgruntled nobles and merchants are plotting to get rid of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName], as they see the current ruler as a menace to their interests and an obstacle to their rise to power. I need to act before it's too late..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.27;Some shady people who should have never been trusted are threatening to reveal the contents of a number of letters between our liege and a 'mystery man'. It is murmured that if the contents were to be made public or were to fall into the wrong hands, the realm's safety itself and even the life of the liege himself could be at stake..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.28;My liege's lady wife has always been known for her 'chastity', but now one of her many lovers is threatening to turn his cloak and reveal some of our dearest held secrets to the best bidder. Something should be done about this before it is too late, and most of all before it reaches my lord liege's ear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.29;Some 'pious men' are starting to doubt my policies as a spymaster, going as far as saying that I'm forsaking God's word for my own goals rather than serving for the best interest of the realm. For how harsh my directives might have been, the realm is safer than ever, and everything is running as smooth as it should. I have to address them before this clash turns into something potentially much more dangerous..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.30;An enemy spy has secretly approached me, offering me to turn his cloak and tell us all he knows about our enemy's weaknesses and plans, in exchange for a certain sum of gold and a safe place to live. My liege wasn't informed yet, leaving me with complete freedom of choice on the matter..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.31;An anonymous courier just reached me with what revealed itself to be a more than worrying missive: someone who signs himself as the 'peasant vendicator' claims that my death is near, and that my alleged ill-doings as a councillor of the realm will not go unpunished. This might not be a serious threat, but it has to be dealt with nonetheless, harshly if need be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob_flavour.32;My liege has been clear: this is the last time my 'sloppy' policies will be tolerated, if I don't change my course of action I will become as expendable as the lamest horse in our stables, those were the exact words. I wonder whether I should apologize for something I clearly haven't done wrong, or if it wouldn't be a better idea to claim my innocence in the recent mishappenings and hope for the best..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.0;My duty as a Knight Templar often clashes with the loyalty I owe to my liege. Many times before I put my brotherhood's interest before anything else of any importance, but this time they are openly asking me to pressure my liege into a more 'appropriate' and Godly path. It is a hard choice indeed, but it also one that has to be done sooner or later, for the best interest of everyone involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.4;The Grand Master thinks this is a great time to show the world our power and the righteousness of our cause by bringing back to Europe an important saint's relic some of his informers located in a desert nearby one of our forts. This might be my chance to shine and prove myself a true Templar Knight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.5;Our enemies are everywhere, and the Hashashins are one of the most powerful and fearsome of them. The Grand Master believes that a pre-emptive strike might serve us best in the struggle against those infidels, claiming that a small mission of brave and pious men sent to assassinate a few selected target behind the enemy lines might do more damage than any battle will, and might turn the struggle to our side..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.6;One of my Templar sergeants threatened me to report my increasingly nightly 'adventures' with the local wenches to the Grand Master. Knowing that he wouldn't approve any of this to say the least, I need to find a way to shut the fool's mouth up before any of this reaches the Master's ears..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.7;Our Templar scouts managed to capture an enemy soldier and brought him back to our headquarters to be questioned and dealt with. As our best 'interrogators' worked their way with him, they couldn't get anything more than a few nonsense stumbling words, no matter how hard they pushed him. After they left the room, I was in charge of dealing with him: question him further, let him be judged by our Lord above or giving the lad a honorable soldier's death, his fate is in my hands now..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.1;The Knight Templars formally asked me to join their ranks. This would mean a great amount of prestige and recognition, but it would also mean leaving the realm for the Holy land and putting all the most pressing matters in the hands of a regent if need be. I need to think about this carefully..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.1;I give up most of my wealth and my ambitions and pledge my sword and loyalty to the Knight Templars!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.9;Our current Grand Master is more idle than not, and all his tactics and strategies have revealed themselves to be nothing less than an utter failure. Since I'm one of the most prominent knights of the order, my brothers asked me to do something about it before the situation turns from tragic to hopeless, something that might very well happen sooner than we all think if we keep following his ill witted leadership..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.10;One of our infidel informants warned me of a plot in act by the Hashashins to get rid of our current Grand Master. After I made sure he was saying the truth and hinted that if anyone else was to know this he would lose more than his freedom, it's now time to decide whether or not to act against it, and if yes in what way..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.11;A group of bandits are tracking me and my group of templar scouts and knights, and it seems as if they are gaining on us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.11;Attempt to avoid them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtemplars.11;Its our duty to stop them..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPtemplars.12;Me and my group of templar scouts will engage the bandits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.12;It is not possible to outrun these bandits, and we are forced to confront them. Our better skill at arms might grant us an easy victory, but those bandits could be more treacherous than sand snakes..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.12;They are few enough to defeat alone..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtemplars.12;Charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.13;One of my scouts just reported me that a party of Hashashins are camping not far away from us. This is a golden opportunity to blow the infidels a decisive strike..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.13;Attempt to ambush them in the night..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPtemplars.11;The Hashashins will face our steel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCtemplars.13;We can't risk it..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.14;Our ambush ended in disaster... Not only did most of the Hashashins get away, but I also got severely injured during the charge that started the ambush.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.14;The bastards got the best of me..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.15;Success! I've left those filthy Hashashins to die in the desert...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.15;Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.16;It seems as if we have managed to get lost here in the desert while scouting for the Grand Master. One of our humble servants seems as if he might know the right way..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.16;I am [Root.GetTitle]! I know the best way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtemplars.16;Listen to the servant...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.17;While on a scouting mission you encounter some fellow pilgrims who are returning home from Jerusalem. They have been beset by bandits who have stolen everything but their clothes and left them with no means to continue the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.17;Here. This should be enough to see you safely home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtemplars.17;Sorry, but I cannot afford to stop and help you. Best of luck to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.18;A strange whistle is heard and the air is suddenly filled with flying daggers and arrows. Robed figures seem to rise out of the sand and the air becomes heavy with dust. It's the Hashashins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.18;Come then. We will sell ourselves dearly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPtemplars.19;You make your last stand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.19;The battle hardens as the Hashashins strike with their ominous blades and arrows, but the final outcome is yet to be decided..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.19;For the glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCromance.18;It can be lonely during a long war campaign, so who can blame a man for having a wench to warm his bed at night? Although it turns out one such wench has had a baby who she claims is mine! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmartial.1;A troubling rumor just reached my ears: a sergeant, one of the most skilled if not the best of our ranks, has been seen coming back to his tent with a young lad, who went out by himself this morning, shortly followed by the naked sergeant shouting obscenities about how he was 'robbed' at a certain brothel and about how a 'cunt' has more balls than the lad does. While his fondness for women was always in doubt, now it is hardly ignorable and some men are growing itchy of being under the command of someone they 'don't trust their arses with'. Something has to be done about it, before this turns into something more dangerous than it already is..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCromance.1;Ever since you have come to serve [Root.Liege.GetBestName], you have found [Root.Liege.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] increasingly irrestible. You may have sworn your fealty to your liege, but lust calls you, stronger than ever..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCromance.2;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName]'s councillor, [From.GetFirstName], a striking young [From.GetManWoman], slips into your chambers late one night.

I beg of you, be MY love, and I will show you a world of which you have never dreamed...';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAromance.2;I thought you'd never ask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCromance.3;You'd thought to pay your [GetFromRelation] a surprise visit in the morning, but as you open your door, you are shocked to see [From.GetHerHim] in the arms of another [FromFrom.GetManWoman] - your trusted councillor, [FromFrom.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAromance.3;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName], what's the meaning of this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBromance.3;[FromFrom.GetFirstName], you traitor, how dare you break my trust?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCromance.3;I... see. So that's how it's going to be. I'll be in my chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPromance.4;will be pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCromance.4;You awaken to find your councillor, [FromFrom.GetFirstName], in the stocks, and your [GetFromRelation] standing guard, sitting on the steps to the keep and calmly eating an apple.

EVTOPTAromance.5;It's not what it... okay, it's exactly what it looks like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPromance.6;will spend a night in the stocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAromance.6;Gods have mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCromance.7;You spend a night of wild passion together, a night only ruined when you awaken to find your [GetFromRelation] standing over the bed, furious.

EVTDESCromance.13;You call for the guards and have the bastard locked in the stocks, taking a seat beside [From.GetHerHim] and biting into an apple.

EVTDESCtemplars.5;After a few days another ship passes nearby, and to everyone's relief their lookout spots your stranded party. For some of the survivors it is too late, but at least you are in good health, as, befitting of your great station, the lion's share of water and food has gone to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.5;Onwards! Home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.6;You take passage on a ship on your way back from the Holy land, but the crew is soon exposed as less than honourable. The captain is overheard discussing how he and his men will sell the passengers he is carrying, including you, into slavery at the next port!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.6;That will not come to pass. To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtemplars.6;We will sneak off the ship just before it docks...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.7;Together with the other passengers, you turn against the crew and a fierce struggle ensues. The battle ends when you run your blade through the treacherous captain's gut and the rest of the crew surrenders. The ship is under your command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.7;Set sail for the homeland!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtemplars.8;As the ship approaches the next port, you quietly slip away into the water, and swim ashore some distance away from the docks as a drenched but free man. The other people on the ship are not so fortunate..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.8;At least now we can get safely home;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtemplars.2;The realm calls me! I'll book a passage on the first ship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEreligious.2;Ad Abolendam;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCreligious.2;Ad Abolendam was a decretal and papal bull, written at Verona in November 1184. It was developed after the Council of Verona settled some jurisdictional differences between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Emperor. The document prescribes measures to uproot heresy and sparked the efforts which culminated in the Albigensian Crusade and the Inquisitions. Its chief aim was the complete abolition of Christian heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAreligious.2;This will be good for the religious peace of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCjudicium_dei.0;You just heard about the chance to demand a trial by fire in order to prove that you've been unjustly imprisoned. If your liege agrees and you survive the ordeal unharmed you will have to be released….that is IF you survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.0;God will prove my innocence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjudicium_dei.0;I'd rather rot here than put my fate in the hands of God..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.1;My prisoner, [From.GetBestName], is claiming to be innocent and that [From.GetHerHis] imprisonment is unjust. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] demands a trial by fire to prove this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.1;Why not? I have no doubt God will support my righteous cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjudicium_dei.1;God may rule in heaven but here on earth 'I' am the law!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.2;[From.GetBestName] has decided to grant your request for a trial by fire. The preparations should begin shortly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.2;Praise to start practicing with my candle, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.3;The dastardly [From.GetBestName] seems to know that God is on my side and thus has denied my request for a trial by fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.3;It might be time to consider paying that ransom…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.4;[From.GetBestName] has decided to let one of [From.GetHerHis] prisoners undergo a trial by fire and is asking you to serve as judge to ensure proper proceedings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.4;Very well, I always enjoy a good barbecue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.5;[From.GetBestName] has been chosen to act as judge in the upcoming trial by fire. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] will ensure that the trial will be fair and that its outcome will only be determined by God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.5;So be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.6;While I have absolute faith in God, I don't trust my prisoner. Who knows, I don't really trust the bastard's honesty.. Maybe I'd better tell my guards to soak the robes that will be worn for the trial in oil?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.6;Sometimes you just have to 'help' justice along... a little.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjudicium_dei.6;That won't be necessary. God will ensure that justice prevails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.7;I have a feeling that my depraved imprisoner will manipulate my trial by fire to make sure that I perish. There has to be something I can do…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.7;If I soak my robes in water, it might protect me from the flames.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjudicium_dei.7;God is on my side. What more protection do I need?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.8;It would seem that [From.GetBestName] is making preparations to manipulate the upcoming trial by fire in [From.GetHerHis] favour. As the judge, I should probably do something…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.8;I shall ensure a fair trial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjudicium_dei.8;If you're not cheating, you're not trying hard enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.9;The day of my trial by fire has arrived. As I stare into the flames I feel a hint of fear but there is no turning back now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.9;These robes aren't flammable, are they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.10;The day of the trial by fire has arrived. After hours of preparing the courtyard, stacking wood and straw and lighting it all up now all eyes are on the prisoner as he makes his first steps towards the blazing flames.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.10;It's time to burn, you scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.11;The day of the trial by fire has arrived. As you watch the guards prepare the courtyard and the prisoner you sit back, knowing that you have done your part in ensuring a fair trial and a great spectacle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.11;Let the show begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.12;It would appear that your fancy robes, while they certainly were most fashionable, also were very flammable. Unfortunately for you, fashion is not taken into consideration during a trial by fire and so you burned to death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.12;At least I'm a very well-dressed corpse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.13;While you knew all along that you were right in imprisoning [From.GetBestName], now everybody else knows it, too. God testified on your behalf by burning [From.GetObjectPronoun] to a crisp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.13;Let's roast some meat while the pyre is still hot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.14;It seems that [From.GetBestName] was guilty of something, after all', you conclude after seeing [From.GetHerHis] charred remains among the ashes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.14;Let's do this again, sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.15;As you emerge from the flames you stop and check every part of your body. To your own surprise you realize that while some of your clothes are more or less gone, you yourself are actually unharmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.15;It's a miracle…erm…I mean, I knew it all along!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.16;You can't believe your eyes as a silhouette steps out of the flames. You immediately send your guards to investigate and to your horror they report that [From.GetBestName] has not been touched by the fire at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.16;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.17;After a while a silhouette emerges from the fiery inferno and as you approach it you recognize [From.GetBestName]. [From.GetHerHis] robes are looking more like a beggar's rags now but [From.GetHerHis] body shows no injury whatsoever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.17;Let [From.GetObjectPonoun] go at once. Deus vult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.18;As you emerge from the flames you stop and check every part of your body. Suddenly you feel a sharp pain and you notice that while you survived, you're also horribly burnt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.18;*faint*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.19;You can't believe your eyes as a silhouette steps out of the flames. You immediately send your guards to investigate and they report that [From.GetBestName] has survived but is also almost unrecognisably burnt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.19;What now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.20;After a while a silhouette emerges from the fiery inferno and as you approach it you recognize [From.GetBestName]. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] is alive but [From.GetHerHis] flesh is horribly burnt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.20;[From.GetSubjectPronounCap] is alive, so [From.GetSubjectPronoun] should go free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjudicium_dei.20;[From.GetSubjectPronounCap] might have survived but clearly not through divine intervention. Back to prison!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.21;Since the result of your trial by fire was inconclusive, it's final interpretation was up to the judge. [From.GetBestName] decided in favour of releasing you but it's a hollow victory as your burn scars will be seen as evidence by your enemies that you were guilty after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.21;Next time I'll just pay the ransom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.22;Since the result of the trial by fire was inconclusive, its final interpretation was up to the judge. [From.GetBestName] decided to release your prisoner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.22;Next time we'll use twice as much wood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.23;Since the result of your trial by fire was inconclusive, it's final interpretation was up to the judge. [From.GetBestName] decided in to keep you imprisoned which would outrage you, if you weren't still unconscious from your injuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjudicium_dei.23;At least I'm still alive, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjudicium_dei.24;Since the result of the trial by fire was inconclusive, its final interpretation was up to the judge. [From.GetBestName] followed your advice and decided against releasing your prisoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmandylion.0;I know it well, but I am occupied with other matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmandylion.0;I will depart immediately to see it with my eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.1;Pilgrims and merchants arriving from Lirey tell with amazement of the 'Shroud', a linen that is supposed to have wrapped the body of Christ, taken from the cross. They say that on it there has mysteriously remained engraved a mystical image;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.2;Seeing the Man on the shroud was an intensely emotional encounter..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.2;It is indeed a divine revelation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmandylion.2;Interesting! Who is the artist that painted it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.4;The Templars have been searching a long time for the 'Mandylion', the shroud that is supposed to have wrapped the body of Christ, taken from the cross. All of traces of it were lost after it was stolen from Byzantium. Today, during a meeting, they have revealed their assumptions and the plans for its recovery..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.4;They are fanatics, I will not join their cause!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmandylion.4;It is probably still guarded in Byzantium…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmandylion.4;I am inspired to look for it in Athens…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmandylion.4;I've heard it's owned by some French noble…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.7;Together with the Knights Templars you have gone to the secret place where you believe the 'Mandylion' to be hidden. The trip is long and full of traps, and in the end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.7;Nothing, it was all for naught!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.8;Together with the Knights Templars you have gone to the secret place where you believe the 'Mandylion' to be hidden. The trip is long and full of traps, and in the end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.8;Ambush!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.9;Together with the Knights Templars you have gone to the secret place where you believe the 'Mandylion' to be hidden. The trip is long and full of traps, and in the end...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.9;It's the Right place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.10;After gathering some information you learn that a rich and influential Jewish family guards the precious relic in their castle..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.10;I have Templars with me! I will demolish the castle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmandylion.10;We will try to steal it, catching them by surprise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmandylion.10;I will personally go to bargain over its purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmandylion.10;I ask permission to see it, and I will return home;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.11;Attacking a castle is not as easy as picking flowers, but it is a grave enterprise, dangerous and with an uncertain result!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.11;I have come and am ready to spill my blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmandylion.11;A different technique could perhaps be found;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.12;The assault in the castle is violent and bloody. Tall flames arise from the Great Hall that holds the relic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.12;Only with great fortune it will be found intact!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.13;To succesfully infiltrate the castle we'll need dexterity and agility, and we should do it unarmed. Nobody is suspicious yet, but the watch is vigilant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.13;One: climb the walls. If it goes wrong, return home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmandylion.13;Perhaps it is best to reconsider this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.14;The watch has not noticed anything! Now we must infiltrate the tower from the courtyard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.14;Two: raise the gate. If it goes wrong, return home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmandylion.14;The hinges are rusted, we'd better think of something else..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.15;They must be deep sleepers not to have noticed all that creaking! Soon, we'll be at the Great Hall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.15;Three: steal the shroud. If it goes wrong, return home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmandylion.15;Detach it from the wall and refold it? There's no time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.16;Damn! People are arriving from the corridors! Hand me the bag with the 'Mandylion', I know what to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.16;Down the window!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.17;You are received with respect, but you find yourself in the presence of wealthy and experienced merchants. It will be difficult to make an agreement on a reasonable price..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.17;I offer 1000 pieces of gold. Are they enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmandylion.17;Why spend money? Let's return and think it over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.18;The gold has been cashed by the treasurer quickly, but it will be sufficient to complete the purchase?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.18;More gold? I hope this isn't a fake..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmandylion.18;No, we risk bankruptcy! Let's change tactics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.29;The 'Mandylion' research has failed! Let's go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.29;Argh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.22;The 'Mandylion' has finally been brought back to the light! A as reward for the abnegation that you have shown, the Grand Master of the Templars entrusts it in custody to you and your descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmandylion.22;As history demands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmandylion.23;After we managed to reacquire the Mandylion, the only thing that's left is to build a proper temple in its honour, so that everyone can admire such miracle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC310001;As I prepare for the blot, there was a knock on the door. As I opened, an old seidmann, ragged of clothing and weathered by the wind stood there. He asks 'Could a wanderer stay until you've had your blot?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD310001;A fellow seidmann? Welcome! Let us talk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC310002;First I need to consider how much food and drink I will purchase for the Blot, to honour the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC310005;As we prepare for the Blot, some of your more… old-fashioned hirdmenn have suggested we send one of Kvitekrists praying men to Valhalla at the Blot…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC310011;As the Blot draws near, it is time to think about which god to honour the most...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC310015;A small group of Berserkers passed by, hearing of your Blot, and asked to be able to join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA310015;Of course. The more the merrier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC340015;Seeing you run the household personally have caused people to talk behind your back…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340015;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340015;Time to teach them why I am the chief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340016;The people of [Root.GetName] have returned to their old ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340016;Hail the Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340017;You were woken up in the early hours in the morning with disastrous news! A thrall had escaped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340017;Oh well…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340017;I will have his head on a spike!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC340017;Cover it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340018;There's been talk among the people that you are too cowardly to go on viking…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340018;I don't care about talk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340018;They think me a coward? Time to pillage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340019;After I returned from the viking, I have heard talk that my dear spouse have been having a lot of fun with my courtiers, servants, hird, thralls, random passers by…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340019;I'm sure there is nothing to the rumours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340019;What? But… only I can do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC340019;Time for a divorce!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD340019;So?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340020;It all became clear this morning. I am the son Odin, the Allfather and creator of man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340020;Hail me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340021;A Godi dared to challenge me today, claiming that no son of Odin should have two eyes! Which I have!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340021;NOT ANYMORE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340021;He… might have a point…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340022;Your husband believes that he is the son of Odin, the Allfather!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340022;Perhaps… perhaps he is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340022;This is what Christians call blasphemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340023;Your wife said she thinks you are the son of Odin, the Allfather!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340023;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340024;Your wife came to you and said that you should stop thinking you are the son of Odin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340024;Begone wife!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340024;Perhaps… Perhaps she is right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340025;As you walked through the farm, you didn't find Hugin and Munin any where! I was certain dad, Odin the Allfather, gave me some!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340025;I'll need new Ravens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340025;No-one has seen them… perhaps I am not the son of Odin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340026;At the Ting, a large group of farmers and hirdmenn challenged my divinity! They asked me why they should think I am the son of Odin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340026;Are my deeds not evidence!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340026;Is my piety not known?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC340026;Could anyone but the son of the Allfather have such deep coffers?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD340026;They should.. Because…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340027;I woke up, thinking of how to divine the future with the Seid knowledge… And realized I don't know how to Seid…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340027;I just need some time! And help! Call for a Volva! I'll pay handsomely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340027;Why don't I know? Am I really of Odin's blood?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340028;Your two ravens, your one eye, your knowledge of Seid all speak for your legitimacy as the son of the Allfather. Luckily, your spouse, the godis and the people also speak for your legitimacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340028;Everybody Hail Me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP340023;Tell him you believe him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340029;It all became clear this morning. I am the son of Loke, the God who will one day betray the Æsir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340029;Hail me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340030;One if by hirdmenn, a large fellow, challenged me to an eating competition to prove I am the son of Loke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340030;Hah! I will easily beat him! My father nearly beat fire once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340030;I'm… not sure I can beat him…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340031;Your husband believes that he is the son of Loke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340031;Perhaps… perhaps he is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340031;This is what Christians call blasphemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340032;Your wife said she thinks you are the son of Loke! In a good way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340032;I might not throw her to the wolves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340033;Your wife came to you and said that you should stop thinking you are the son of Loke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340033;I understand her not trusting the son of Loke, but she must still leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340033;Perhaps… Perhaps she is right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340034;A Godi, wise in the ways of the Gods, claim you aren't Loke! He says you must prove yourself by tricking him into giving up a pouch of silver!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340034;This should be easy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340034;I'm not entirely sure about this…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340035;At the Ting, a large group of farmers and hirdmenn challenged my divinity! They asked me why they should think I am the son of Loke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340035;Is my cunning not evidence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340035;You want evidence? I will give you evidence…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC340035;Could anyone but Loke have such deep coffers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD340035;They should.. Because…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340036;As everyone knows my father is versed in shapeshifting and seid. Then why don't I know how to seid?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340036;I just need some time! And help! Call for a Volva! I'll pay handsomely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340036;I… Don't know…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340037;Your deceitful nature, your silver tongue, your nefarious schemes… you are the son of Loke, at least in your own eyes and in the eyes of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340037;Everybody Hail Me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340038;It all became clear this morning. I am daughter of Freya, Goddess of Love, Beauty and Battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340038;Hail me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340039;One of my hirdmenn laughed when I said I was the daughter of Freya! He said I wasn't pretty enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340039;I will show him! I am the daughter of Freya! Goddess of Beauty! I WILL BECOME BEAUTIFUL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340039;Not pretty? But… I'm Freya's blood… Aren't I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340040;Your wife believes she is the daughter of Freya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340040;Perhaps… perhaps she is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340040;This is what Christians call blasphemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340041;Your husband said he thinks you are the daughter of Freya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340041;I might limit myself to his bed… for a few days…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340042;Your husband came to you and said that you should stop thinking you are Freya's daughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340042;What? That… that… I don't want to see him again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340042;Perhaps… Perhaps he is right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340043;An old Godi, ugly and short, said he and his brethren would not believe your are Freya's daughter until you sleep with him, the most loathsome of them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340043;Can you wear a bag? No? Oh well… Let's get this over with…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340043;What? No… I won't…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340044;At the Ting, a large group of farmers and hirdmenn challenged my divinity! They asked me why they should think I am Freya's daughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340044;Is my looks not evidence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340044;Is my silver tongue not evidence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC340044;Could anyone but Freya's daughter have such deep coffers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD340044;They should.. Because…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340045;My mother taught Odin himself the art of Seid! Then… how come I can't remember how to do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340045;It'll come back… I'll hire a Volva to make it come back faster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340045;I… Don't know…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340046;You are Freya's daughter. Your looks, liberal views on matrimony, your looks, your knowledge of seid, your silver tongue and your looks have convinced the people, the godis and the chiefs that you are Freya, Goddess of Beauty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340046;Everybody Hail Me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340047;A young warrior with nothing to lose and everything to gain stopped me on the path, challenging me to a duel then and there… my entire Hird is watching…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340047;Duel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340047;Back down and pay him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340048;I'm a coward, a laughing stock, a disgrace to my family… Perhaps I should try to be braver?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340048;Yes! I must be brave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340048;No, better to be an honest coward than a lying warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340049;As a Seidmann I occasionally do get into trouble. This is one of those times, as I find myself surrounded by five burly, drunk, men throwing slurs at me while brandishing weapons…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340049;They want to mess with a Seidmann? TO VALHALLA!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340049;Flee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340050;Your children are also recognised as having the blood of Loke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340050;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340051;Your children are also recognised as having the blood of Odin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340051;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340052;Your children are also recognised as having the blood of Freya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340052;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340053;Seeing as how you don't believe the old gods exist, why do you claim you are of their blood..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340053;I no longer claim to be of divine blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340053;You are right! Hail Odin! Hail Tor! Hail Freya! Hail Loke! Hail…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpagans.14;You can now centralize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTApagans.14;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340054;Your acts have no gone unnoticed by the powerful in the realm, and the Tings are about to declare you a Niding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340054;I suppose there is nothing I can do…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340054;My silver will sway the tings my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC340054;My friends will sway the tings my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD340054;My hirdsmenn will cut down whoever speaks against me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340055;There is a possibility that your niding situation might be resolved in the next Ting…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340055;I sure hope so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340055;Let us make it a guarantee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340056;Due to having been declared a Niding, it is not dishonourable, nor even punishable, to slay you and take your wealth… A band of warriors have attacked you and your Hird!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340056;To valhalla!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340057;Your husband is really not the man you had hoped for to marry…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340057;Time for a divorce!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340057;We can make it work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC340058;I fear that my death is approaching quick… Will I see the glory of Valhalla, or am I doomed to crippling boredom in Hel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA340058;Challenge the strongest man in the realm to a fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB340058;Time to raid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC340058;I'm sure I got a bit of life in me left…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350000;The Norse care not for who you choose to sleep with, as long as you're not weak about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350000;Pffh, I'm man enough to sleep with other men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350001;You… don't want to have sex? Ever? Odd…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350001;It is my choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB350001;You might have a point…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350002;You enjoy life, and no-one faults you for that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350002;More mead! More women!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350003;An affair or two won't get the Volva or Seidmenn angry at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350003;Thank Odin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350004;You don't want to..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350004;No, not with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350005;A whole pig and two chickens in one meal… You're the talk of the town!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350005;And tomorrow it will be two!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350006;Some want more. You are not some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350006;I'm content;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350007;When you stood in front of the wolf, unflinchingly staring it down, all knew you were brave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350007;I don't even know what 'fear' means!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350008;No norseman can respect someone who runs away from danger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350008;I don't flee I make a tactical retreat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350009;Being able to lift up two thralls at once truly makes your fellow warriors respect you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350009;[Root.GetFirstName] smash!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350010;As the scrawny monk thrall smashed your fist onto the table while the entire court watched, you knew you wouldn't be able to live it down…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350010;He is stronger than he looks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC350011;You are no longer considered as this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA350011;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC331100;The ignorant farmers think that your Seid has hurt their crops! Fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA331100;Fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC331101;A wanderer have told you that your [From.GetJobTitle], [From.GetTitledName], has commited Seid that has damaged the crops and killed the livestock!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA331101;It is just superstitious farmers…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB331101;Throw  [From.GetHerHim] into the dungeon! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC331102;The weather, the animals, the rumours… All can be omens, and you know this is a good one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA331102;Hill Freya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC331103;Your [From.GetJobTitle], [From.GetTitledName], has given me an omen to…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA331103;Conquer! I must prepare for the future battles at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB331103;Prosper! I should make an investment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC331103;Rule! Time to get the Chiefs and Jarls under my banner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD331103;Scheme! Now is the time to prepare for plots!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC331104;The weather, the animals, the rumours… All can be omens, and you know this is a bad one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA331104;Hill Freya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC331105;Your [From.GetJobTitle], [From.GetTitledName], has foreseen bad portents..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA331105;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB331105;Right, 'portents'…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC331105;Give an alternative reading of those portents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME331100;Volva scares locals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME331102;Volva sees a good omen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME331104;Volva sees a bad omen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME331106;Volva cures local child's disease!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC331106;It took weeks of nurturing and the best of my herbal knowledge, but the seemingly doomed child walked again today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA331106;Hill Freya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC331107;Your [From.GetJobTitle], [From.GetTitledName], has cured a local child of a seemingly lethal and cruel disease!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA331107;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB331107;Really?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330000;You are not a Volva!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330000;I am a Seidmann;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330001;You are not a Seidmann!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330001;I am a Volva;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330002;The disease simply won't leave… I'm weak… Perhaps I should seek out a volva or seidmann?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330002;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB330002;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC330002;My spouse knows Seid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330003;The disease simply won't leave… I'm weak… It seems like it is time to use my skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330003;Now to seek out some herbs…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330004;My… condition… have plagued me and my family for so long, perhaps the Volva can cure it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330004;It is worth a try;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB330004;No;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330005;There was a knock on the door, and a volva stood outside asking if I wanted to know my future in return for some shelter and food…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330005;The future? Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB330005;Tell her 'no', but give her food and shelter for the night anyway;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC330005;Slam the door in her face!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330006;There's an old Seidmann living in the woods, a strange fellow occasionally giving sage advice. Some locals have come to you to have him removed, as he is reputed to be involved in human sacrifice, cannibalism and wearing cats on his head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330006;Gather the hird! I'll deal with this seidmann!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB330006;Seid can't do anything against me! I'll deal with him personally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC330006;Well, we'll just have to live with this seidmann…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD330006;I'll speak with him, Seidmann to Seidmann.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330007;A seidmann approached me today, having heard of my knowledge and piety, and offered me to learn the ways of Seid…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330007;The secrets of Seid will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB330007;What? Seid is for women and 'men'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330008;A volva approached me today, having heard of my knowledge and piety, and offered me to learn the ways of Seid…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330008;The secrets of Seid will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB330008;No, I got better things to do than dance naked in the forest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330009;One of your vassals have proven to be quite ambitious… perhaps too ambitious…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330009;With Seid, the vassal will be dealt with!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB330009;A bit of ambition isn't bad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP330010;Seid is discovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP330011;Seid is successful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP330012;Seid is lethally successful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330010;[From.GetFirstName] tried to commit seid on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330010;That niding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330011;Something… something isn't right… is this seid?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330011;Odin, protect me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330012;Struck dead with Seid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330012;I still get to Valhalla, right? Right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330013;Your rival has been a thorn in your side for long… Perhaps it is time to deal with this situation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330013;Time to get some herbs…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB330013;Seid isn't for personal vendettas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP330014;Reveal the coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330014;Disaster! Your intended victim survived the Seid, and even worse, know it was you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330014;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330015;The seid was successful! Your victim languishes from his last meal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330015;Hill Freya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330016;The seid was successful! Your victim lies dead, struck down by poison!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330016;Hill Freya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330017;No follower of the Lord should do sorcery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330017;I recant my wicked ways!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330018;There was a knock on the door to the kungsgård you currently reside in. Outside stand a volva, asking for a place in your household…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330018;Allow her to stay;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB330018;Give her shelter and food for a few days;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC330018;Refuse her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330019;My wounds have not healed… Perhaps I should see a Volva?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA330019;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB330019;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC330019;My spouse knows Seid and looks at my wounds anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP322000;Surprised by knights!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC322000;As you and your men plunder, you are beset by a group of heavily armed knights!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA322000;To Valhalla!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB322000;He who runs away, lives to plunder another day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC321000;As the months pass, the men begin to get restless for home and wives…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA321000;Let us get home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB321000;Just one… more… village…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320000;A small fishing village has been spotted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320000;Pillage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB320000;Trade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC320000;Leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320001;A fishing village has been spotted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320002;A monastery has been spotted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC321001;At first, the creaking of the longboat could have been anything… but as the creature got into sight, there could be no doubt. The Kraken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA321001;Valhalla awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB321001;Every man for himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320003;A town has been spotted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320004;An armed merchant ship has been spotted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC321002;Some of your less-than-loyal subjects have used the opportunity provided by you being on viking to try to seize power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA321002;Why can't they let me have any fun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC321003;With the ships heavy with gold and valuables, most of your men see no reason to continue on the raid…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA321003;Time to return to our farms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB321003;Heavy with riches? NOT ANY MORE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC360000;While you have claimed this title, you have yet to have the approval of the Tings, consisting of all freemen in the realms, to rule… The tings are in session.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA360000;I will make my case!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC360001;The majority of the Tings have approved your rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA360001;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAintrigue.1;I'll invite them to a nice 'feast';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCfealty.0;As soon as I rose to rightfully hold my titles, my Chancellor reminded me the urgency for a commendation ceremony to be held in [Root.Capital.GetName] in front of all my fellow vassals and feudal lords who will, one by one, swear fealty and loyalty to me as their rightful ruler. As for the ones who will refuse to pay homage, there will be a different sort of treatment..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfealty.0;Send out emissaries to the lords of the realm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfealty.1;My liege, [From.GetTitledName], will hold a commendation ceremony soon. My feudal duties command me to attend the ceremony and swear fealty to [From.GetHerHim], otherwise the consenquences might be dire..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfealty.1;I'll become 'the man'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfealty.1;I won't bend my knee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfealty.2;[From.GetTitledName] refused to attend the commendation ceremony and hence swear fealty to your noble and enlightened rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBfealty.2;[From.GetTitledName] will pay for this outrage! TO WAR!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEfealty.4;The Commendation Ceremony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfealty.4;All my vassal appeared bareheaded and weaponless as a sign of their submission to my will and knelt before me. They then, one by one, clasped their hands before me and stretched their clasped hands outward. I grasped their hands between my own, they  announced they wished to become 'the man', and I accepted their fealty. They then placed their hands on a Bible, and swore: 'I promise on my faith that I will in the future be faithful to the lord, never cause [From.GetHerHim] harm and will observe my homage to [From.GetHerHim] completely against all persons in good faith and without deceit.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfealty.4;Such a grand ceremony!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfealty.5;By the Lord before whom this Bible is holy, I will to [From.GetTitledFirstName] be true and faithful, and love all which [From.GetSheHe] loves and shun all which [From.GetSheHe] shuns, according to the laws of God and the order of the world. Nor will I ever with will or action, through word or deed, do anything which is unpleasing to [From.GetHerHim], on condition that [From.GetSheHe] will hold to me as I shall deserve it, and that [From.GetSheHe] will perform everything as it was in our agreement when I submitted myself to [From.GetHerHim] and chose [From.GetHerHis] will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfealty.5;I swear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfealty.6;I didn't swear fealty to my liege yet, and as the official commendation ceremony was attended by my predecessor and not by me, my feudal obligations require me to ride to [Root.Liege.Capital.GetName] and pay homage to my ruler as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfealty.6;I'll become 'the man'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfealty.6;I won't bend my knee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC750357;My vassal [From.GetTitledFirstName] has just arrived to [Root.Capital.GetName] to bend the knee to my rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA750357;A wise choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAfealty.7;ARGH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfealty.7;[From.GetTitledName] will pay for this outrage! TO WAR!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfealty.8;My liege [From.GetTitledName] just sent me an envoy with a declaration of war against my 'unlawful' and 'unholy' rule after I decided not to swear fealty to [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfealty.8;TO ARMS!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC750360;With getting involved in my current war against my former liege, I broke the oath of fealty I swore long ago. Now everyone will see me as an oathbreaker, and my former liege will be mad as hell when words of this will start to spread around, not being angry enough about the oathbreaking..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA750360;The end justifies the means, I guess;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfealty.9;[From.GetTitledName] has broken the oath of fealty [From.GetSheHeCap] swore me! What an unlawful bastard, this is an unbelievable dishonour for both [From.GetHerHim] and the realm as a whole!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfealty.9;It will not go unpunished;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCholy_see.9;When the chaplain told you [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was looking for you, you weren't sure what to expect. Certainly, you weren't expecting to find [FromFrom.GetHerHim] wearing a purple gown and hat!

EVTOPTA515528;Craven to the bone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC515529;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has somehow survived the slaughter! And the bad news are not over: as soon as [From.GetSheHe] got back to [From.GetHerHis] castle, [From.GetSheHe] raised [From.GetHerHis] levies and is now marching towards us! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA515529;The bastard! TO ARMS!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.11;[From.GetTitledFirstName] lies dead on the great hall's blood covered floor, [From.GetHerHis] throat slit by one of my assassins. Together with [From.GetHerHim] lie [From.GetHerHis] personal guard and entourage, all slaughtered on the way of vengeance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.11;[From.GetSheHe] should have thought twice before betraying me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.11;I'm too busy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.12;Through my sources I have learned that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] will be visiting his favourite courtesan at the local brothel in [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName] sometimes in the next weeks. The guards will keep a close watch on the streets, but will they expect an assassin to come from the inside?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.12;My co-conspirators will find a good man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.12;Hire an assassin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.12;I know just the man for this job...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDintrigue.12;This isn't a good idea after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.13;I decided to visit my favourite courtesan at [Root.Location.GetName], but as soon as I got to her room I found an hooded man waiting for me with a knife in his hand and a wry smile on his face..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.13;My God. He's going to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.13;Run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.13;Attempt to kill [This.GetTitledFirstName] when he will visit his favourite courtesan sometimes in the next weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.14;The man reaches me before I can react, and his knife slits open my throat..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.14;This was no madman. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] orchestrated this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.15;Argh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.16;The hooded figure charged at me with his knife still, but thanks to what must surely have been the intervention of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], I miraculously managed to get an hold of my sword and slain him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.16;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has conspired to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.17;Who was he working for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.18;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledFirstName] is proceeding well. [From.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronounCap] will soon be assassinated while visiting his favourite courtesan in [From.PlotTarget.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.19;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was killed by the assassin we sent over at the brothel. Unfortunately, he was caught and blame spilled my name under torture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.20;Success! [From.GetTitledFirstName] was killed by the assassin we sent over at the brothel. The story we concocted about a 'hateful madman' seems to be working perfectly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.20;One less threat to the establishment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.21;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to fight back and kill our assassin, who deliriously made my name before dying..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCintrigue.22;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to fight back and kill our assassin, but at least he died before he could talk and the conspiracy remains uncovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.23;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] will soon be going on an hunting trip with his entourage and his personal guard. With boars and other dangerous beasts running around, not to mention arrows flying in every direction, so many things could go wrong during a hunt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.23;My co-conspirators will bribe a hunter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.23;Bribe an hunter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.23;I have some leverage on one of the hunters...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.24;The hunting trip is going well, together many other skilled hunters you will be getting into the wild soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.24;I can't wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.24;Why is that hunter so nervous?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.24;Arrange for [This.GetTitledFirstName] to perish in a hunting accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.25;One of your hunters tracks a boar and gives you the first shot. As quietly as possible, you draw your bow, take aim and send an arrow into the small animal's flank. Filled with satisfaction you turn around, only to see the hunter aiming his own bow at you, fully drawn. '[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] sends his regards,' he whispers before sending the arrow into your throat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.25;Gghh... [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] got to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.26;W-why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.27;As the hunter's behavior becomes increasingly nervous and erratic you decide to confront him about it. Finally he breaks and admits to having been paid a handsome sum to kill you during the hunt and make it look like an accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.27;So you were paid by [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.28;And you say you never saw the face of your employer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.29;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is proceeding well. A hunter going with him on a trip to the wilds has been generously bribed to cause a tragic hunting accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.30;Success! The hunter did what he was paid for and made sure [From.GetTitledFirstName] never returned from the hunting trip. Unfortunately, he later lost his nerve and told everyone willing to listen about my involvement as he drank away his sorrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.31;Success! The hunter did what he was paid for and made sure [From.GetTitledFirstName] never returned from the hunting trip. He will keep quiet about his ghastly deed to save his own skin if nothing else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.31;To hunt a man is truly the greatest sport...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.32;Failure! That fool hunter lost his nerve and failed to kill [From.GetTitledFirstName]! What is more, he told the [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] everything about the conspiracy - including my involvement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.32;I knew we couldn't trust him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.33;Failure! That fool hunter lost his nerve and failed to kill [From.GetTitledFirstName]! At least he has decided to keep quiet about the conspiracy to hide the shame of his own involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.34;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] will soon be going to visit one of [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] most powerful friends in [Root.PlotTarget.Location.GetName]. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] thinks that no one else other than the little guard [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] will bring along and [Root.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] friend know about this trip. [Root.PlotTarget.GetSheHe]'s wrong, we know the route and we could ambush their party in an alley we made sure they will have to walk through..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.34;My co-conspirators will find the right thugs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.34;Bribe thugs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.34;I know some men for the job...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.35;The trip is going well, we almost reached our destination when we come through an obstacle on the main street. 'There is an alley I know that leads right past this block' a guard says. As soon as you enter the alley a strange whistle is heard and the air is suddenly filled with flying bolts and arrows. Cloaked figures seem to rise out of nowhere and the air becomes heavy with battle... It's an ambush!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.35;Argh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.35;Men, to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.35;Arrange for [This.GetTitledFirstName] to perish in an ambush.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.36;The ambushers have the best of you and your men, and leave you slain in the alley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.36;Et tu, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], fili mi?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.37;Et tu, Brute, fili mi?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.38;As the worst of the ambush seems to fade away, I'm able to re-organize my men and fight back the attackers until they retreat! One of them is left behind with a mortal wound, and before he dies I'm able to grasp a few words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.38;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]... [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.39;Ghhghh;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.40;[From.GetTitledName] has let me know that the plot to kill [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is proceeding well. An ambush has been set to take place soon and ensure [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] departure from this world-;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.41;Success! The ambushers easily overcame and slaughtered [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] guards. Unfortunately, one of the men involved later lost his senses and told everyone willing to listen about my involvement as he drank and fucked away his pay in a brothel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.42;Success! The ambushers easily overcame and slaughtered [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] guards. They also managed to get away unnoticed, and the blame fell on one of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s many other enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.42;Perfect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.43;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to fight back our ambushers, leaving many of them dead or fatally wounded. One of them deliriously made my name before dying..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.43;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.44;Failure! [From.GetTitledFirstName] managed to fight back our ambushers, leaving many of them dead or fatally wounded. Thankfully they all died before they could talk, so the conspiracy remains uncovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC910910;For as long as have ruled here we have entrusted the raising of our children to Langobardisch and Greek nursemaids.

EVTDESC910923;I was considering important business when I had an amazing insight. To strengthen my realm I must bring my vassals round to my way of thinking. This involves communication. If I can get them to communicate like me then I will have a much smoother running realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA910923;Sometimes I even surprise myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC910924;My Liege has persuded me to embrace this notion of Southern Italianness that is sweeping the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA910924;Now, let's dance a tarantella!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.3;The sack of Aachen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.3;Even Aachen, the former seat of Charlemagne's great Carolingian empire, has fallen under the grasps of our power. The city's riches are now being looted by our men with the order to bring them to the capital immediatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.3;There's a lot to plunder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.4;The sack of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.4;We were finally able to break the siege of Paris and sacked the city. The still unfinished Notre Dame Cathedral is quickly set on fire and with the light provided by the rest of the burning city, our men can continue looting and murdering well into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.4;So many riches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.5;The sack of London;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.5;No sea nor land has proved a formidable enough barrier to halt our advance. London has fallen, and the city is now the scene of a savage looting and slaughter on a scale unrivaled since the days of Queen Boudica and her rebellion. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.5;Sack the city!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.6;The sack of Rome;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.6;We have breached the Aurelian Walls, and our armies are now on the field of the Circus Maximus while we set up camp on the Palatine Hill. No mercy will be shown to those Romans who have not yet fled the city, or paid with all their riches. It is the direness of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.6;Veni, Vidi, Vici;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.7;The sack of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.7;Venice is ours! The canals have been blocked by the bloated corpses of the dead as the city is sacked by our frenzied soldiers. Those few fortunate enough to have escaped the slaughter are now claiming the bodies are packed tightly enough in the Venetian Lagoon for one to ride to and from the mainland as he pleases. The razing continues..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.7;There is no force in the decrees of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.8;The sack of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.8;The Theodosian Walls have not been enough to spare Constantinople from being taken. The great imperial capital has been sacked, its citizens butchered, its women raped, the Hagia Sophia defiled and the Great Palace of the emperors put to the torch. And it's inestimable riches are now on their way to our capital and treasury..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.8;Silent leges inter arma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.9;The sack of Lisbon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.9;Lisbon has fallen! While the city burns at our touch, I look out over the great blue expanse of the Atlantic. Who can stop us now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.9;No place is beyond our reach;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.11;The sack of Prague;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.11;The city of Prague has become a beacon of light in an otherwise dark world, as the Mongol barbarians move from house to house and set fire to everything not yet looted. A flood of refugees spread horrific tales about the cruelty of the bloodthirsty Tartar horsemen to every corner of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.11;Have they no regard for culture?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.12;The sack of Vienna;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.12;Vienna, a city of growing importance on the Danube river, has fallen to our army. The smoking ruins and butchered corpses we left behind after the sack do not lend much faith in the city's immediate future prospects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.12;Pro aris et focis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.13;The sack of Esztergom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.13;The Hungarian city of Esztergom has fallen to our hands and is now the scene of indiscriminate pillage and slaughter. As the sack goes on, those few remaining soldiers that attempt to flee on foot are cut down without mercy by our vanguards as dark, billowing smoke rises towards the sky above the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.13;Ostendite modo bellum, pacem habebitis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.14;The sack of Athens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.14;The ancient city of Athens has fallen to our hands, and we can now rampage unchecked behind its walls. Great monuments and artifacts dating back to the dawn of Western Civilization are stolen or lost forever in a cultural desecration that will surely be felt by future generations thousands of years from now. The riches accumulated by our men will surely be enormous..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.14;This time they have gone too far!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.15;The sack of Belgrade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.15;The 'White City' has turned red as we breached Belgrade's walls and massacred its guards and inhabitants without exception. After several days of slaughter and looting, the smell of death and rotting flesh proves too much even for the most endured soldier to bear, as we move on with many of the city's riches in our coffers..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.15;War its thousands slays, but peace its ten thousands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.16;The sack of Baghdad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.16;The great city of Baghdad, one of the world's foremost centers of learning, has succumbed to our great army after a siege. Nothing can now stop us from what announces itself to be a wonderous pillage. The Tigris river runs not only red with blood, but black with the ink of priceless and irreplaceable tomes from the House of Wisdom and the city's other great libraries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.16;The brazen throat of war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.17;The sack of Damascus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.17;Damascus, the ancient City of Jasmine, has been sacked by our armies. Some of our most frenzied men have gathered a colossal pile of severed heads of civilians and enemy soldiers alike on a field just outside the city walls, now renamed 'burj al-ru'us' by the massacre's few survivors - the Tower of Heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.17;Only the dead have seen the end of war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.18;The sack of Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.18;We were finally able to break the siege and conquer Jerusalem! As we pillaged and slaughtered, many of the inhabitants sought shelter in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Dome of the Rock, and the Temple Mount. Our soldiers were killing and slaying even to the Temple of Solomon, where the slaughte rwas so great that it is said that our men were wading in blood up to their ankles..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.18;Death is not a punishment, but the end of it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.19;The sack of Alexandria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.19;After taking the city by force, our ranks swept through the city like hungry falcons attacking a flight of doves, with loose reins and victorious faces, murdering and spreading terror. Beds and cushions made of gold and encrusted with jewels were cut to pieces with knives and torn to shreds. Those hiding inside their homes were dragged through the streets and alleys, each of them becoming a plaything, as the population dies at our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.19;May they suffer an eternity of pain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.20;The sack of Cairo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.20;Riding through the fertile Nile Delta, we have arrived at the Great Pyramids of Giza and breached the gates of Cairo. Surely even the strongest Pharaoh would be given pause by the pain and misery now inflicted on the city's guard and population, and by the raging pillage that is taking place in the aftermaths..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.20;Vae Victis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEsacks.21;The sack of Mecca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsacks.21;The Holy City of Mecca now burns at the cruel touch of the Mongol infidels. Pilgrims journeying from distant lands to show their submission to Allah are met only with death when approaching the city gates. This unforgivable desecration will be remembered for ages to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsacks.21;Not a single infidel taking part in this affront will escape justice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIPBATTLECHARGE;Victory is not ours yet. Charge at the enemy with full strength, may it lead us to glory, or to a glorious death. Shame for the ones who break, honour to the brave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIPBATTLERETREAT;Retreat! Order the men to fall back, as it's not time to win or lose this battle just yet. Although many commanders will see this choice as craven, I know better..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTIPBATTLEFIGHTBACK;The enemy charges, but victory isn't lost yet. Hold on and counter-attack with what strength we have left: may it lead us to glory in victory, or to a glorious death in battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.50;I was finally able to pull all the needed threads for the conspiracy to get started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTAintrigue.50;A desperate disease requires a dangerous remedy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.51;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the conspiracy is in motion. [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.51;Thrilling news;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.52;The conspiracy goes on: One of my associates has pointed out that we need some support from the inside in order for my masterplan to be successful. Although I agree with him, there are many paths I could follow..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.52;Diplomacy is the path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.52;Scheming is the way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.52;I trust only steel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.53;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], It appears we both have similar concerns against [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] and to that end I propose we establish a relationship where we could both benefit.\n\n Regards,\n[From.GetFirstName] [From.GetOnlyDynastyName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.53;If the money is right..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.53;Interesting, I will think about it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.53;I won't get involved in such business;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDintrigue.53;This is treason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.54;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], Your proposal is most intriguing. I think a fair amount of gold would convince me to be part of this conspiracy.\n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.54;Give [From.GetHerHim] what he wants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.54;[From.GetSheHe] asks too much;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.55;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], You and your agents make a convincing argument, but alas I am unsure. I will have to ponder before I can be sure this is the right thing to do.\n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.55;Some gold should convince [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.55;Keep trying to persuade [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.55;Forget it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.59;will receive your gift and respond;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.60;will continue to be cajoled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.56;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I'm afraid I don't see eye to eye with you on this, I will not be part of this conspiracy. Be thankful that I choose not to speak of this attempted treachery.\n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.56;Loyalty, such a foreign word to my ears;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.56;We need to cut out the loose ends;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.57;Grave news, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has informed [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] of your treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.57;Argh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.57;[From.GetSheHe] will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.58;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], I regret to inform you that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has attempted to bribe their way into my loyalty in order to conspire against your life and titles. I'm sure you appreciate me telling you as soon as this dishonourable proposal was presented to me. \n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.58;Treason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.59;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I'm glad we have a common interest in this matter, here is a gift as a token of my goodwill. \n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.59;I'm convinced;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.59;This is just too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.60;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s agents continue to cajole me, in order to try and win my support for their plot. They do make some convincing arguments to conspire with [From.GetHerHim], but they want my commitment soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.61;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\n  I have decided that working together in your conspiracy's interest is the right thing to do. My loyalty is yours to this end. \n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.61;[From.GetSheHeCap] is most wise;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.62;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I have decided that conspiring with you is not in my best interest. I do not want to be approached by your agents again.\n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.62;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.63;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], you are most wise, here is your gift as requested. I hope our relationship will be fruitful. \n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.63;So much gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.64;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I have decided that having you on the conspiracy is not in our best interests after all. \n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.64;As you wish..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.65;I'm supporting a perilous conspiracy against my lord. This is a very risky state of affairs..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.65;Some more gold would make me feel more safe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.65;I cannot risk this any longer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.66;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], if you want me to keep being part of the conspiracy against [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] I request a higher pay, as my role inside it has greatly increased after the last developments\n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.66;I don't think so;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.67;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I'm afraid this conspiracy has become too risky and that I cannot be part of this conspiracy any longer. I hope you understand. \n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.67;But we had an arrangement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.68;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I have decided that your part in our conspiracy is most valuable now more than ever and that extra compensation is indeed due to you. \n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.69;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I have decided that our 'relationship' is not actually worth the price you set upon it, and your role in the conspiracy terminates as of now. You know what will happen to you if anyone will ever hear anything of this. \n\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.70;Rumors are that the actual romantic life of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] isn't in the most orthodox of states, with a lustful triangle with [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] spouse and one or more lovers involved taking place. My conspiracy could greatly benefit from this situation, as long as we contact the right party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.70;Have my agents contact [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] spouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.70;Have my agents contact [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.71;Now that we have ears and eyes in [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s bedchamber, we learned that [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] lover and spouse are bitterly quarreling over [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] favour now more than ever before. If [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] was to be found dead in such a situation, the blame would certainly go to either one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.71;[Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] spouse will arrange things for us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.71;[Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] lover will arrange things for us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.71;We will arrange things ourselves and let the blame fall on either of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDintrigue.71;It's not a good idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.72;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], we have planned the assassination of [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]. We know you could be most useful to us, especially in getting our man inside [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s bedchambers, and in the aftermath, in letting the blame fall on one of [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s many enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.72;I know of a certain secret passage that leads to the bedchamber..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.72;This is not what we agreed on, I will tell [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.72;This is not what we agreed on, I want more gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDintrigue.72;This is not what we agreed on, I want a title when things are set;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEintrigue.72;I can't do this, I'm out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.74;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], if you want my help to assassinate [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] I request a title when things are set, as my role inside it has greatly increased after the last developments\n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.74;Fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.77;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I have decided that your part in our conspiracy is most valuable now more than ever and that extra compensation in the form of a title and the conservation of your current status is indeed due to you. \n\n Regards,\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.75;Everything is set for the assassination: my man will go and infiltrate inside [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s bedchambers late at night, when we know [Root.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronoun] will be meeting [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] lover. After the deed is done, our man will leave clear proof of [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] spouse involvement in the room, and the knife he will be using to assassinate the couple in [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] spouse's chambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.75;[Root.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronoun] will feel a thousand deaths, in fearing one;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.75;This isn't such a good idea after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.76;Everything is set for the assassination: my man will go and infiltrate inside [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s bedchambers late at night, when we know [Root.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronoun] will be in a deep sleep and unguarded. After the deed is done, our man will leave clear proof of one of [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] lovers' involvement in the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.78;As I approach my bedchambers, I find [Root.Lover.GetBestName] naked waiting for me on the bed. I start getting undressed and in the arousement I don't notice the quick steps coming from behind me until it's too late. With a face full of terror [Root.Lover.GetBestName] falls under a dozen stabs, as another hooded figure runs towards me with the intent of slitting my throat..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.78;Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.79;[Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] has been murdered together with [From.Spouse.GetHerHis] lover, and I have been blamed for it! Apparently the knife used for the murder was found in my bedchamber, together with a letter proving my involvement in the deed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.80;[From.GetTitledFirstName] lies dead on [From.GetHerHis] bedchamber's blood covered floor together with [From.Lover.GetBestName], their throat slit by my assassins. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.80;Just as I planned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.80;Time to send the heir an ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.80;Tell the bought marshal to get his men ready;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.81;[From.GetTitledFirstName] somehow managed to elude my assassins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.81;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.82;As I'm in deep sleep in my bedchambers, I don't notice the quick steps coming from the door towards me until it's too late. As I'm finally awaken and I open my eyes I see an hooded figure running towards me, knife at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.82;Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.83;[From.GetTitledFirstName] lies dead on [From.GetHerHis] bedchamber's blood covered floor, [From.GetHerHis] throat slit by my assassins. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.84;My Chancellor just delivered me a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName], telling me to consider well what was written there. It goes: 'For far too long you and your family have blocked my God-given right to rule the [Root.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullBaseName]. Recognize my rightful claim and step down peacefully or meet me sword in hand. Rest assure that I have enough supporters to obtain this either way, as your late predecessor might have noticed. You surely don't want to end up like that.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName]';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.85;Rather than risking civil war tearing the realm apart, I have decided to give in to your demand and hand my title over to you. But this treacherous act of blackmail will not be forgotten...\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.85;You will be, though;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.87;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s agents just delivered me a very important missive. So it goes: It's time to act. Gather the troops loyal to you under my banner, and together we will overthrow [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] and take the realm. \n\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.87;Consider it done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.87;I will do it for a title and the martialship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.87;I'm out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.89;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s marshal has gathered the troops loyal to him and is now waiting for my orders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.89;Storm the castle and bring [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] to me alive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.89;Storm the castle and kill [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.89;Take the capital while [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] is away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.90;Treason! [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] has gathered troops loyal to him underneath [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s banner and is now storming the castle! [From.GetSheHeCap] wants to capture me and usurp the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.90;Guards! To Arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.91;Victory! Our troops have succesfully stormed the castle and captured [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The throne is now mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.91;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.92;May our luck be damned! [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s loyal troops were able to hold off our men and kill the marshal in the process. We are now in open war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.92;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.93;Treason! [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] has gathered troops loyal to him underneath [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s banner and is now storming the castle! [From.GetSheHeCap] wants to kill me and usurp the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.93;Guards! To Arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.94;Victory! Our troops have succesfully taken [From.Capital.GetName] and slain [From.GetTitledFirstName]. The throne is now mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.94;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.95;With the help of our inside connections, I was able to get a claim on the [Root.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullBaseName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.95;Perfect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.96;Treason! [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] has gathered troops loyal to him underneath [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s banner and is now attacking [Root.Capital.GetName]! [From.GetSheHeCap] wants to usurp the throne while I'm away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.96;Hopefully most of the guards will stay loyal to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.97;Victory! Our troops have succesfully taken the capital! The throne is now mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.97;Grand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.97;There is one last piece to settle..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.98;[Root.Capital.GetName] has fallen to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s treasonous army and [From.GetSheHe] has seized the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.98;Argh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.98;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.99;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has declared war on you after you seized the capital and the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.99;I'll crush [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.100;After I chose to switch to [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s side, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] welcomed me to [From.GetHerHis] court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.100;This is my place now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.101;Seeing [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] with [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] nose deep in the cup at a feast last month, it suddenly struck me that all I need to get rid of [Root.PlotTarget.GetObjectPronoun] is a fine poison...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.101;My associates will provide the poison;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.101;Buy a rare poison;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.101;Hemlock goes well with the Red...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.103;Success! [From.GetTitledName] died of the poisoned wine. Unfortunately, my complicity was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.103;Fling but a stone, the giant dies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.103;Time for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.104;Success! It seems the wine did not agree with [From.GetTitledName]. [From.GetSubjectPronounCap] died not knowing the name of [From.GetPossPronoun] killer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.104;Death is a black camel, which kneels at the gates of all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.105;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s realm is currently at war, a perfect occasion for my conspiracy to get in motion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.106;I've just learned that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] will be visiting an important merchant in the capital soon. No one knows what route [Root.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronoun] will take, except from [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] spymaster. If I got to know it as well, an ambush could be easily set.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.106;Contact the bought spymaster immediatly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.107;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s agents just delivered me a very important missive. So it goes: It's time to act, I need to know the route [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s carriage will take during [From.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronoun] forthcoming visit to one of the most important merchants of the capital.  \n\n\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.107;I want a title and the spymaster position;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.109;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s spymaster has told me the route that [Root.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronoun] will take when visiting an important merchant in [Root.Capital.GetName] next week. Now everything is ready to set an ambush..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA15659;My men will be in position;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.112;Success! The ambushers easily overcame and slaughtered [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetHerHis] guards. Thanks to the spymaster's involvement, they also managed to get away unnoticed, and the blame fell on one of [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s many other enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.113;The tyrant [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s time is up. With [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun]'s marshal on my side, I could easily seize the throne if something was to happen to [Root.PlotTarget.GetObjectPronoun]. Most of the capital's guards and army estates are already in the conspiracy, and it would be easy to get one of them to do the deed for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.113;Contact the marshal immediatly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.114;[From.GetTitledName]'s agents just contacted me with a decisive missing: 'The tyrant [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s time is up. We need one of your men in [From.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] personal guard to do the deed. In the meanwhile, rally the troops loyal to us and get them ready to seize the capital as soon as word of [From.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] death will spread.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.114;The Captain of the guard is one of us;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.114;This will earn me more than some gratitude;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.114;I'm not going to be part of this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.118;Everything is ready for the final threads to be pulled: [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s marshal has rallied the men loyal to our cause under our banners just outside the capital, and the captain of [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s personal guard will turn his cloak and assassinate [Root.PlotTarget.GetObjectPronoun] as soon as I give word to the marshal to attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.118;Carpe diem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.119;The enemy is at the gates! [From.GetTitledName]'s and [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] armies combined together under [From.GetTitledName]'s banner are now marching towards the capital, in a treasonous attempt to seize my throne! As I turn towards my guard's captain to order him to prepare for battle, he swiftly sheathes his sword with the intention of swinging it towards my neck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.119;Et tu, Brute? Fall [Root.GetTitledName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.120;The assassination failed! [From.GetTitledName] was only wounded by the guard captain, who was then slain by the guards loyal to [From.GetHerHim]. Apparently we miscalculated the support we had among their ranks, and now the secrecy of our intent is compromised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.120;It's war now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.121;Victory! Our man has succesfully slain [From.GetTitledFirstName], and as soon as word of [From.GetHerHis] death reached the capital, we were welcomed as liberators by the cheers of the smallfolk and nobles alike! The throne is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.122;I was miraculously able to escape the coup d'etat and the many attempts on my life thanks to the loyalty of most of my guards, who refused to turn the cloak to [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and protected me in the direst stages of the ordeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.122;Time to strike back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.123;I was miraculously able to escape the assassination attempt on my life thanks to the swiftness of my guards, who arrived just in time to save me from the hooded figure who was trying to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.124;I can't be completely sure yet, but it seems that a conspiracy to overthrow [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] is currently in motion. All I miss to piece everything together is the name of the mastermind behind this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.125;It seems that [From.GetTitledName], [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s spymaster, has found out more than [From.GetSheHe] should have about my conspiracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.125;This is unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.125;[From.GetSheHeCap] needs to die;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.126;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s realm is in a state of regency, and the current regent is not remotely as powerful nor as influential as I am. With the silent support of my conspiracy backers, I could addempt taking it for myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.126;There's no time to lose;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.126;I don't think this is the right path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.127;[From.GetTitledName] is attempting to take the regency!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.127;[From.GetSheHeCap] must have strong backers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.128;The regency is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.128;A bright day;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.129;Your attempt to take the regency ended in an utter failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.129;It won't stop me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.130;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] unsuccesfully attempted to steal the regency from you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.130;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] must be mad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.131;With a swift diplomatic move, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] took the regency from you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.131;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] must have had powerful backers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.132;As regent of the realm, my conspiracy to acquire the [Root.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullBaseName] is stronger than ever. The ruler is too young to interfere, and with the right move I could put my hands on the crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.132;And thus I clothe my naked villainy ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.132;We go to use our hands, and not our tongues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.133;I will never be able to take the [Root.PlotTargetTitle.GetFullBaseName] from [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] with [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] mother's family in such an influential position at court. Something needs to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.133;Have the mother imprisoned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.133;Have the mother and her family imprisoned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.133;We needn't be so blunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.134;[From.GetTitledName]'s guards are at the door! They want to imprison me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.134;I won't be taken so easily;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.135;Your guards' attempt to imprison [From.GetTitledName] failed! [From.GetSheHeCap] was somehow able to escape [From.GetHerHis] chambers as soon as [From.GetSheHe] heard my men coming for [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.135;Alas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.136;[From.GetTitledName] is safely locked in the dungeons of your castle. [From.GetSheHeCap] was (falsely) accused of plotting against the realm and the murder of its regent, [Root.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.136;Say, have I thy consent that [From.GetSheHe] shall die?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.136;Brilliant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.137;[From.GetTitledName] had you falsely tried for treason committed against the realm because of your alleged role in a conspiracy to assassinate [From.GetHerHim]. You have been sentenced to death and are now awaiting execution!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.137;O bloody [From.GetTitledName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.138;[From.GetTitledName] has been tried and executed for treason committed against the realm because of [From.GetHerHis] alleged role in a conspiracy to assassinate its regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.138;I hope [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is speaking the truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.139;Now that the Queen Mother is not an obstacle anymore, I can focus on what to do with [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] and [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] male siblings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.139;Have [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] imprisoned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.139;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] and [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] brothers imprisoned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.139;This is too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.140;[From.GetTitledName]'s guards are taking me to the castle tower!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.140;What does this mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.141;[From.GetTitledName] is now locked in the dungeons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.141;Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead, and I would have it suddenly performed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.141;There will be no more blood on the path to the throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.141;[From.GetSheHe]'s safe there;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDintrigue.141;Get rid of [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.142;[From.GetTitledName] had you executed because of the threat you represented to the legitimacy of [From.GetHerHis] claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.142;So wise, so young, they say, do never live long;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.143;[From.GetTitledName] had you executed to clear [From.GetHerHis] path and is now attempting to seize the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.143;So wise, so young, they say, do never live long;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.144;With your life and freedom in [From.GetHerHis] hands now, [From.GetTitledName] is now attempting to seize the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.144;Argh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.145;Failure! After [From.GetTitledName]'s execution, my attempt to seize the throne was everted by the vassals still loyal to [From.GetHerHim]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.145;What is done cannot be now amended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.146;Victory! After [From.GetTitledName]'s execution, there were no more obstacles on the path to the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.146;But shall we wear these glories for a day? Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.147;Failure! After sparing [From.GetTitledName], my attempt to seize the throne was everted by the vassals still loyal to [From.GetHerHim], who were able to set [From.GetHerHim] free and are now at war with me together with [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.147;What is done cannot be now amended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.148;Victory! With [From.GetTitledName] safely locked up in my dungeon, there were no obstacles on the path to the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.148;But shall we wear these glories for a day? Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.149;[From.GetTitledName]'s attempt to seize the throne failed, and your loyal vassals were able to set you free during the confrontation that took place in the aftermath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.149;I'll face the traitor in battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.76;Inform [From.GetTitledName] of your consent in being part of [From.GetHerHis] plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.73;Ask [From.GetTitledName] for a higher compensation for your role;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.67;[From.GetTitledName] will be very disappointed of hearing of my rejection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.74;Ask [From.GetTitledName] for a title as compensation for your role;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.78;Send your men to assassinate [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.82;Send your men to assassinate [This.GetTitledFirstName] and let the blame fall on [This.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.93;Have your and the marshal's men assault the capital, take its castle and attempt to assassinate [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] in order to usurp the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.96;Have your and the marshal's men take the capital and usurp the throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.150;You have learned from your informants in the council that [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s daughter in law might be having an affair with a courtier. If words of this were to reach [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s ears, there would be no mercy for her nor for her lover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.150;This could prove to be useful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.150;I don't mind for such trifles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPintrigue.151;Send [Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] an anonymous missive revealing the affair;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.151;I just received a very worrying anonymous letter, describing in detail an affair between my daughter in law and a nobleman of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.151;This is lese-majesty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.151;No one needs to know this..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.152;My wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] has just been arrested together with [From.Lover.GetBestName] for high treason and lese-majesty because of having an affair with him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.152;And I didn't know anything of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.153;You have just been arrested together with your lover, [Root.Lover.GetBestName], for high treason and lese-majesty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.153;I beg forgiveness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.154;[From.GetTitledName] is now safely locked up in your dungeons, awaiting trial for [From.GetHerHis] accusations of high treason and lese-majesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAintrigue.154;[From.GetSheHeCap] will have [From.GetHerHis] life safe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.154;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.155;You have just been sentenced to death for high treason and lese-majesty, and are now awaiting to be executed on the orders of [From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.156;Your wife, [From.GetTitledName], has been sentenced to death and executed for the crimes of high treason and lese-majesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.156;The whore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.157;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s heir is very skilled and well loved by the subjects of the realm. This could represent an obstacle for my conspiracy to overthrow [Root.PlotTarget.GetObjectPronoun], if [Root.PlotTarget.GetSubjectPronoun] was to die prematurely and the throne pass onto [Root.PlotTarget.GetPossPronoun] heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.157;Something needs to be done about it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.157;I need to follow another path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.158;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName]'s heir is very fond of wine and rides in the countryside. If we are to strike, we have to use his weaknesses against him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.158;I will have him poisoned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.158;I know of another way..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.158;I don't think this is a good idea after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.161;I've been promised a title for my role in the recent conspiracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.161;A debt that needs to be paid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.161;I dare not ask;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.162;[From.GetTitledFirstName] just reminded me of the title I've promised [From.GetHerHim] because of [From.GetHerHis] pivotal role in my recent conspiracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.162;[Root.GetOnlyDynastyName]s always pay their debts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.162;What title? I can't remember;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCintrigue.162;Will no one rid me of [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.163;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has granted you a title and the same status you held prior to the conspiracy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.163;The end justifies the means;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.164;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused to give you the title that [From.GetSheHe] promised you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCintrigue.165;Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand, blood and revenge are hammering in my head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.165;I will have my revenge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.166;A bishop subject of mine is far too ambitious for his own good. His talks of God and his love are ruining all the good things we have built in those years, and sensibly weakening my rule and my status..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.166;Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBintrigue.166;He's a man of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.167;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s knights have come for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.167;For the name of Jesus, I am ready to embrace death;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCintrigue.168;The wicked knight leapt suddenly upon [From.GetTitledFirstName], cutting off the top of the crown which the unction of sacred chrism had dedicated to God. Next he received a second blow on the head, but still he stood firm and immovable. At the third blow he fell on his knees and elbows, offering himself a living sacrifice, and saying in a low voice, 'For the name of Jesus and the protection of the Church, I am ready to embrace death'...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAintrigue.168;I didn't mean THAT;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
