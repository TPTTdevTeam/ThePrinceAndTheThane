BM_NYMPHAEUM;Treaty of Nymphaeum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NYMPHAEUM_DESC;The Treaty of Nymphaeum was a peace treaty signed between the Nicaean Empire, successor state of the Byzantine Empire, and the Latin Empire, which was established in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade of 1204.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EL_CID;El Cid Campeador;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EL_CID_DESC;"Rodrigo Dìaz de Vivar, also known as ""El Cid"", was a Castilian nobleman, military leader, and diplomat. Exiled from the court of the Spanish Emperor Alfonso VI of León and Castile, El Cid went on to command a Moorish force consisting of Muladis, Berbers, Arabs and Malians, under Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud, Moorish king of the northeast Al-Andalus city of Zaragoza, and his successor, Al-Mustein II. After the Christian defeat at the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086, El Cid was recalled to service by Alfonso VI, and commanded a combined Christian and Moorish army, which he used to create his own fiefdom in the Moorish Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia. Rodrigo Díaz was educated in the royal court of Castile and became the alférez, the chief general, of Alfonso VI, and his most valuable asset in the fight against the Moors.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FOUNDING_OF_JERUSALEM;The Kingdom of Jerusalem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FOUNDING_OF_JERUSALEM_DESC;The crusaders arrived at Jerusalem in June 1099, a few of the neighbouring towns (Ramla, Lydda, Bethlehem, and others) were taken first, and Jerusalem itself was captured on July 15. On 22 July, a council was held in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to establish a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond IV of Toulouse and Godfrey of Bouillon were recognized as the leaders of the crusade and the siege of Jerusalem. Raymond was the wealthier and more powerful of the two, but at first he refused to become king, perhaps attempting to show his piety and probably hoping that the other nobles would insist upon his election anyway..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FOUNDING_OF_LATIN_EMPIRE;Founding of Latin Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FOUNDING_OF_LATIN_EMPIRE_DESC;May 16th, 1204 AD. The Fourth Crusade originally preached by Pope Innocent III has ended in tragedy for the Eastern Roman Empire. Crusading forces, deep in debt to their Venetian financers, were successfully diverted from their target in Egypt to wealthy Constantinople, the capital of Byzantium, in order to sack the city and take over its trade routes. After the capture of the Roman heartland, the leaders of the crusade established a western catholic feudal crusader state in the conquered territory, called the Latin Empire of Constantinople, with the goal of supplanting as titular successors the shattered Byzantine Empire in the east. Today Baldwin I., count of Flanders, was crowned the first Latin emperor and the task he faces is enormous: Who will triumph in this struggle?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KOMNENOS;The House of Komnenos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KOMNENOS_DESC;"The Komnenos dynasty of Byzantine emperors was founded by Isaac I Komnenos, a Stratopedarch of the East under Michael VI. In 1057 Isaac led a coup against Michael and was proclaimed emperor. Although his reign lasted only till 1059, when he was pressured by his courtiers to abdicate and become a monk, Isaac initiated many useful reforms. The dynasty returned to the throne with the accession of Alexios I Komnenos, Isaac I's nephew, in 1081. By this time, descendants of all the previous dynasties of Byzantium seem to have disappeared from the realm, such as the important Scleros and Argyros families. Descendants of those emperors lived abroad, having married into the royal families of Georgia, Russia, France, Persia, Italy, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia; thus it was easier for the Komnenos family to ascend to the throne.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_INTERREGNUM;Interregnum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_INTERREGNUM_DESC;May 21st, 1254 AD. After the death of Holy Roman Emperor Frederik II of the House Hohenstaufen in 1250, one of the most powerful rulers the empire has ever seen has been replaced by a weak infant heir, his son Conrad IV, and the numerous enemies of the dynasty, chief among them the papacy, sense weakness. The German kingdom has been divided among Conrad and the anti-king Willhelm II of Holland, who both seem unable to stop the continuing disintegration of central rule as the independent-minded princes consolidate their holdings. Without a king capable of achieving universal recognition, the Holy Roman Empire has entered the Great Interregnum. In the shadow of the weak rulers, numerous contestants plot to lay claim to the throne - who shall emerge victoriously?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MONGOLIAN_EMPIRE;The Mongol Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MONGOLIAN_EMPIRE_DESC;In less than 80 years, a band of warriors originally comprised of several men grew to an empire that encompassed all from the Pacific Ocean to the Danube River. This story is about one of the most dramatic series conquests in history and how it was the Mongols themselves who shattered their own invincibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WALK_TO_CANOSSA;The Walk to Canossa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_WALK_TO_CANOSSA_DESC;In 1075, right after the 'Dictatus Papae', Heinrich IV installed his chaplain, Tedald, as Bishop of Milan, when another priest of Milan, Atto, had already been chosen in Rome by the Pope for candidacy. In 1076 Gregory VII responded by excommunicating the king, removing him from the Church and deposing him as German king. German princes and the aristocracy used the cover of religion as an excuse to continue the rebellion started at the First Battle of Langensalza. Thus, because of these combining factors, Henry IV had no choice but to back down, needing time to marshal his forces to fight the rebellion. In 1077 he traveled to Canossa in northern Italy to meet the pope and apologize in person. As penance for his sins, and echoing his own punishment of the Saxons after the First Battle of Langensalza, he dramatically wore a hairshirt and stood in the snow barefoot in the middle of winter in what has become known as the Walk to Canossa...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FRIEDRICH_BARBAROSSA;Friedrich I Barbarossa;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FRIEDRICH_BARBAROSSA_DESC;"Frederick I Barbarossa was a German Holy Roman Emperor. He was elected King of Germany at Frankfurt on 4 March 1152 and crowned in Aachen on 9 March, crowned King of Italy in Pavia in 1155, and finally crowned Roman Emperor by Pope Adrian IV, on 18 June 1155. He was then also formally crowned King of Burgundy at Arles on 30 June 1178. The name Barbarossa or Rotbart came from the northern Italian cities he attempted to rule, and means ""red beard"" in Italian – a mark of both their fear and respect..";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FIRST_CRUSADE;The First Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FIRST_CRUSADE_DESC;In March 1095, Alexios I sent envoys to the Council of Piacenza to ask Pope Urban II for aid against the Turks. Urban responded favourably, perhaps hoping to heal the Great Schism of forty years earlier, and to re-unite the Church under papal primacy by helping the Eastern churches in their time of need. In July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. The enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of 'Deus vult'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NM_BM_BLOTSVEIN;Blot-Sven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NM_BM_BLOTSVEIN_DESC;The pagan Sven Kol, commonly known as 'Blot-Sven', has been made King of Sweden after Inge the Older tried to outlaw the practice of Blot in Uppland, turning the Tings against him. Will Blot-Sven be able to bring back the Old Ways to Sweden, or will he perish against the christian Götlanders and the christian kings in Norway and Sweden?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_SCOURGE_OF_GOD_DESC;From the East they came, ruthless and without mercy: strange men, dressed in exotic armor and speaking in guttural tongues that none understood. Rumors carried across the Silk Road and the Indian Ocean have told of how Genghis Khan and his invincible Mongol hordes shattered the greatest empires of the known world, from Cathay to Persia. Though Genghis Khan is now dead, the sons and grandsons of Genghis intend to continue his conquests. They have their eyes upon Europe and the rest of the Middle East, and the entire world may be united under the banner of Genghis... if his descendants do not end up fighting among themselves, that is. Perhaps the end of days has finally come at last, a punishment for the sins of the wicked... or perhaps this is God’s greatest test yet for the faithful.; ; ;; ;;;;;;;;;x

BM_OSMANS_DREAM_DESC;With the breakup of the Sultanate of the Rum and the decline of the Byzantine Empire, several warlords in Anatolia seek fame and glory in the ensuing power vacuum. Foremost among them is Osman, a pious and brave man. According to a dream he had many, many years ago, some say that great things will be in store for Osman and his dynasty, and that they might even conquer great Constantinople one day. But the journey to Constantinople won’t be easy, and the Byzantine Empire, which has resisted attack after attack for almost a thousand years, will not go down without a fight.; ; ;; ;;;;;;;;;x

BM_KHITAN_DESC;For more than two centuries, the Khitan were the rightful rulers of northern China, perfectly balancing their traditional, nomadic way of life, and the urbane, sophisticated culture of their Chinese subjects. However, overthrown by their Jurchen vassals in the early years of the 12th century, remnants of the once-great Khitan have fled to Central Asia, where they seek to re-create their imperial splendor. Having just defeated the once-mighty Kara-Khanids and the Seljuks, the Khitan now have a foothold in the region. Will they continue their conquests, spreading their Sinicized nomadic culture and their Buddhist faith, or will they settle down, content with re-creating their Chinese empire in Central Asia?

BM_THE_ISLES;King of Dublin and the Isles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_ISLES_DESC;Gudrød Crovan, of both Norwegian and Irish descent, has finally succeeded in expanding his Kingdom of Mann and the Isles to include his birthright, the Kingdom of Dublin. The day of the Norwegian conquerors is over, dead with the failure of Harald Hårdråde at Stamford Bridge, but Gudrød Crovan is not Norwegian. He is half the blood of conquerors and half Irishman. From his foothold in Dublin, can he expand and proclaim himself Ard Rí ua Éire, or will Malcolm Dunkeld of Scotland contest him for the lands he believes are his own birthright?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NORWAY_1;The Collapse of the Isles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NORWAY_1_DESC;The Kingdom that Gudrød Crovan worked his entire life to create is no more. Dead of the plague, Gudrød's Kingdom has fractured. While King Magnus III of Norway has reasserted hegemony over much of Gudrød's old land, Galloway and Dublin have both declared independence from the Norwegian King. The north of Albion lies in flux: will Magnus be able to avenge his defeated grandfather the Hårdråde and terrorise the shores of Albion once again, or will Edgar, the young King of Scotland, be able to use this transition to his advantage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EDGE_OF_KNIFE;The Edge of the Knife;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EDGE_OF_KNIFE_DESC;The Western World stands upon the edge of a knife. In Iberia, the Almoravid Sultanate is nearing total victory, with Alfonso of Castille-León barely holding on to the north of España, and the Kingdom of Aragón-Navarra and the Duchy of Barcelona barely surviving at the French border. Across the Mediterranean, although the Komnenos do well against the Turk, Sultan Kilij Arslan still holds much of Anatolia under his grasp, and looks with greedy eyes toward the independent Duchy of Armenia Minor. Iberia or Anatolia, Castille or Byzantium: will the heathens succeed in breaking the iron walls of Christianity and finally breech the interior of Europe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ANTIOCH;The First Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ANTIOCH_DESC;In the aftermath of the First Crusade, the Levant is a divided land. In the north, the Principalities of Antioch and Edessa vie for superiority, both against the Muslims and each other. The Prince of Antioch, Bohemond, is in constant contention with Thoros, the Orthodox Duke of Armenia Minor, whose lands he has usurped. To the south, the infant Kingdom of Jerusalem is balanced against the weakened Fatimid Caliphate, the large Emirate of Damascus, and myriad minor sheikhs dividing it from the Princes to the north. Can the Catholics hold, or will another Crusade need to be called to secure the existance of a Catholic Holy Land?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_JERUSALEM;Jerusalem at its Height;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_JERUSALEM_DESC;Jerusalem stands at its highest point. The Principality of Antioch has been absorbed and the Kingdom has expanded inland, toward the Sinai peninsula and Damascus. Although Jerusalem's size and strength goes a long way to secure Catholic dominance in the Levant, everything is far from guarenteed. Damascus and Aleppo still stand as guards against the massive Seljuk Sultanate to the East, and the Fatimid Caliph smarts over the losses Egypt suffered during the First Crusade. Jerusalem has many enemies, and few friends. Will the Levant be Catholic, Shia, or Sunni?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_POMERANIA;A Catholic Pommerania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_POMERANIA_DESC;The pious Ratibor I of Pommerania has declared himself independent of the Kingdom of Poland and converted to Catholicism. Aside from weakening Poland, Ratibor's actions are totally unexpected. The Pommeranian people flock to his banner, and the sky is his limit. Ratibor seeks nothing less than to craft a Kingdom from the ashes of the pagans around him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SERBIA;Fall of the Komnenoi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SERBIA_DESC;"The Komnenoi have fallen from the Imperial Throne, and chaos reigns in the Byzantium. The newly-formed Kingdoms of Serbia and Bulgaria have declared their independence from the Byzantine crown, the Seljuk Sultans of Rum press against the Empire's restored borders in Anatolia, and an independent Belá III rules in Hungary-Croatia. All of Manuel Komnenos's dreams have come to naught,"" but this is a time of opportunity, for those wise enough to see it. Alexios Komnenos"", infant son of Manuel, rules in Trebizond. If he can gather support enough to press his claim on Byzantium, the young Komnenos can work to restore the golden age his father's untimely death brought to a close.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_IBERIA;The Iberian Campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_IBERIA_DESC;Iberia is balanced between the Muslims and Christians. In the north the Catholics divide the land between five Kingdoms: Portugal, León, Castille, Navarra, and Aragón. To the south, the Muslims are unified under the powerful Almohad Sultanate. Is this a time of opportunity and growth for the Christians, or has the Almohad Sultan amassed enough power to finally breach Europe proper?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ARMENIA;The Kingdom of Armenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ARMENIA_DESC;Levon I has proclaimed the Kingdom of Armenia, birthed from the Duchy of Armenia Minor. Surrounded by Muslims as this new-found Kingdom is it is doubtful that it will survive long enough--or grow large enough--to be worthy of that name… but who knows? Perhaps Levon has seen what other men cannot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_TURMOIL_IN_THE_EAST;Turmoil in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TURMOIL_IN_THE_EAST_DESC;The Fourth Crusade has left Byzantium crippled, and its prior vassal states do not fare much better. Three powerful Dukes vie for control of Greece proper, and only one of them are Greek. The hatred between the Latin and Byzantine Empires has not abated,  but neither has progress been made toward discovering the final victor in their struggle. Glory and titles are there, for a man--or woman--strong enough to seize them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FRACTURE;The Fall of Rûm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FRACTURE_DESC;Plagued by the Mongols to the east and decadence within itself, the Sultanate of Rûm has collapsed. In its place a half-dozen Sultans have risen, all claiming to be Rûm's true successor. The Byzantine Empire, labored and barely standing, has recovered Constantinople, but its strength to do more than that is in question. Many other lords and lands have interest in the east, not to mention Naples and the still-warring Dukes in Greece, but regardless of if it is desired, this is one man's time. A great nation must rise from the ashes of Rûm--or Byzantium--and whoever succeeds in unifying the disparate peoples of the Aegean shall have power enough to challenge the gateguard of Europe, Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SWEDEN;Magnus IV;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SWEDEN_DESC;"Magnus IV, by election King of Sweden and by birthright King of Norway, has temporarily united much of Scandinavia under his rule. Unless Magnus proves to be an exceptional King it is unlikely that the union will live beyond him,"" but there are those who whisper of an Empire of the North, with Magnus I at its head….";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ITALY;The Italian Campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ITALY_DESC;The Holy Roman Empire is in decline, and Italy has finally been completely freed from its grasp. Dukes war with counts, mayors with Doges. Who will unite Italy--or will Italy be united at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SALADIN;Saladin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SALADIN_DESC;Saladin, a Kurdish Sunni Muslim, has usurped the Sultanate of Egypt from the Shia Fatimids, turning his back on his benefactor Nur ad-Din, Emir of Aleppo, and causing great tension in the Crusader States. Although Saladin is likely to be preoccupied for a time with the Emir of Aleppo, not to mention his own Shia subjects, it is only a matter of time until the holy warrior turns his eyes toward the states of Jerusalem and Antioch….;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ANARCHY;The Anarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ANARCHY_DESC;The Anarchy was a period of early English history in which the dynasty of the Norman conqueror William broke down and was replaced by the half-cadet, half-bastard house of Plantagenet. It began when the second Norman King of England, Henry I, died without legitimate issue. Although Henry attempted to place his daughter Matilda on the throne, the lords of England would not have it. In his daughter's place, a male descendent of William through the female line, Stephen de Blois, was declared king. Support for Stephen was not absolute, however, and there were many loyalists who sided with Matilda in the succession. Matilda herself was married to the bastard son of King Foulque of Jerusalem, Geoffrey of Anjou, later to be known as Geoffrey Plantagenet. Geoffrey has managed to conquer Normandy in her name, and the succession crisis between the powerful vassal and the weak King Stephen of England appars to be inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LITHUANIA;Lithuania Converts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LITHUANIA_DESC;In the face of Teuton invaders on one side and the Golden Horde on the other, the people of Lithuania have seen fit to unite in common cause--survival. Although under their first kings they maintained Romuvan sympathies, the new King, Vaisvilkas Gediminaitis, has seen the writing on the wall. He has converted to Orthodoxy to foster better relations between the other realms that have become the inadvertant gateguards of Europe, the Kings of Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Grand Duke of Novgorod. Although Vaisvilkas's realm is small for the moment, his timely conversion to Christianity buys him time and potential support from other Christian rulers.  If he can gain that support and use it to hold of the Mongol horde, the ambitious young King of Lithuania might well be able to recover some of his ancestral lands lost to the Teuton knights….;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_HABSBURG;The Habsburgs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_HABSBURG_DESC;Rudolf von Habsburg, current Holy Roman Emperor, has put down Ottokar II of Bohemia, his only rival for the Imperial throne. With Ottokar's defeat much of his lands have defaulted back to the crown, including the duchy of Österreich, which Rudolf has entrusted to his son, Albricht. Although the succession is secure and a new age has begun with the Habsburg control of Österreich, not all is well in the Empire. The Kingdom of Sicily has broken out of the firm control that Frederick Barbarossa held it with, and has even begun expanding, conquering much of the coast of Greece and even the Duchy of Provence. Inspired by the succession crisis and Sicily's success, many small states of northern Italy have declared independence. History calls the Habsburgs one of the most succesful houses of the Medieval period, but now they face the potential collapse of the Empire's control of the Italian peninsula. Stop the collapse, for the glory of the House of Habsburg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
